# Chainlink Retryable External Adapter Template

This template provides a basic framework for developing Chainlink external adapters in NodeJS. Comments are included to assist with development and testing of the external adapter. Once the API-specific values (like query parameters and API key authentication) have been added to the adapter, it is very easy to add some tests to verify that the data will be correctly formatted when returned to the Chainlink node. There is no need to use any additional frameworks or to run a Chainlink node in order to test the adapter.

## Creating your own adapter from this template

Clone this repo and change "MyProject" below to the name of your project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thodges-gh/retryable-external-adapter.git MyProject
```

Enter into the newly-created directory

```bash
cd MyProject
```

You can remove the existing git history by running:

```bash
rm -rf .git
```

Now make changes to the adapter to suit your needs. There are test helpers included in `test/helpers/` so that you can mock responses from the endpoint without having to hit the API each time you run tests.

## Install

```bash
npm install
```

## Test

```bash
npm test
```

## Create the zip

```bash
zip -r cl-ea.zip .
```
